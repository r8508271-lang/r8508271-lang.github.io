- Arm orientation (quaternion)
- Gripper position (open/close)


## Variant

Open a kitchen-island drawer and sweep five cubes into it.

## Action Space

Actions: base pos and yaw (3), arm joints (7), gripper pos (1)

## Reward

The primary reward is for successfully placing objects at their target locations.
- A reward of +1.0 is given for each object placed within a 5cm tolerance of its target.
- A smaller positive reward is given for objects within a 10cm tolerance to guide the robot.
- A small negative reward (-0.01) is applied at each timestep to encourage efficiency.
The episode terminates when all objects are placed at their respective targets.
